					<p>From this origin of the instrument, the word “shell” is often used as synonymous with “lyre,” and figuratively for music and poetry. Thus Gray, in his ode on the “Progress of Poesy,” says:</p>

					<p>The goddess of innocence and purity. After leaving earth, she was placed among the stars, where she became the constellation Virgo⁠—the Virgin. Themis (Justice) was the mother of Astraea. She is represented as holding aloft a pair of scales, in which she weighs the claims of opposing parties.</p>
					<p>It was a favorite idea of the old poets that these goddesses would one day return, and bring back the Golden Age. Even in a Christian hymn, the “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Messiah</span>” of Pope, this idea occurs:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">

					<p>Several cities are allotted to King Arthur by the romance-writers. The principal are Caerleon, Camelot, and Carlisle.</p>
					<p>Caerleon derives its name from its having been the station of one of the legions, during the dominion of the Romans. It is called by Latin writers Urbs Legionum, the City of Legions. The former word being rendered into Welsh by <i xml:lang="cy">Caer</i>, meaning city, and the latter contracted into <i xml:lang="cy">lleon</i>. The river Usk retains its name in modern geography, and there is a town or city of Caerleon upon it, though the city of Cardiff is thought to be the scene of Arthur’s court. Chester also bears in Welsh the name of Caerleon; for Chester, derived from <i xml:lang="la">castra</i>, Latin for “camp,” is the designation of military headquarters.</p>
					<p>Camelot is thought to be Winchester.</p>
					<p>Shalott is Guilford.</p>

					<p>Amongst all the characters of early British history none is more interesting, or occupies a more conspicuous place, than the hero of this tale. Urien, his father, was prince of Rheged, a district comprising the present Cumberland and part of the adjacent country. His valor, and the consideration in which he was held, are a frequent theme of Bardic song, and form the subject of several very spirited odes by Taliesin. Among the Triads there is one relating to him; it is thus translated:</p>
					<p>“Three Knights of Battle were in the court of Arthur: Cadwr, the Earl of Cornwall, Launcelot du Lac, and Owain, the son of Urien. And this was their characteristic⁠—that they would not retreat from battle, neither for spear, nor for arrow, nor for sword. And Arthur never had shame in battle the day he saw their faces there. And they were called the Knights of Battle. <a href="chapter-3-3.xhtml#noteref-60" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Before the sixth century all the silk used by Europeans had been brought to them by the Seres, the ancestors of the present Boukharians, whence it derived its Latin name of Serica. In 551 the silkworm was brought by two monks to Constantinople; but the manufacture of silk was confined to the Greek empire till the year 1130, when Roger, king of Sicily, returning from a crusade, collected some manufacturers from Athens and Corinth, and established them at Palermo, whence the trade was gradually disseminated over Italy. The varieties of silk stuffs known at this time were velvet, satin (which was called “samite”), and taffety (called “cendal” or “sendall”), all of which were occasionally stitched with gold and silver. <a href="chapter-3-3.xhtml#noteref-61" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The terms of admiration in which the older writers invariably speak of glass windows would be sufficient proof, if other evidence were wanting, how rare an article of luxury they were in the houses of our ancestors. They were first introduced in ecclesiastical architecture, to which they were for a long time confined.

					<p>Throughout the broad and varied region of romance it would be difficult to find a character of greater simplicity and truth than that of Enid, the daughter of Earl Ynywl.

					<p>The character of Enid is admirably sustained through the whole tale; and as it is more natural, because less overstrained, so perhaps it is even more touching than that of Griselda, over which, however, Chaucer has thrown a charm that leads us to forget the improbability of her story. <a href="chapter-3-7.xhtml#noteref-65" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
